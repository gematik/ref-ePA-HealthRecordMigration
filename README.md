## About Health Record Relocation
This repository provides technical information for the Electronic Health Record (ePA) application as part of the Telematic Infrastructure (TI).

Health Record Relocation applies when a particular health record shall be moved from one health record system to another ("Relocation"). The process itself is defined in chapter "Health Record Relocation Service" of specification 'gemSpec_Aktensystem_ePAfuerall" and involves the ePA-Basic interfaces I_Health_Record_Relocation_Service and I_Information_Service_Accounts.

One step of the relocation is the exchange of encrypted health record content, collected in a single Zip-file - the export package. The structure of the export package and its enryption is defined here: [Package-Exchange encryption](./as-wechsel/Readme.md) and [Export-Package](./docs/Healthrecord%20relocation%20export%20package.adoc).

This branch relates to **ePA version 3.1** (3.1.X)</br>
See [Branchinformation.md](./Branchinformation.md) for links to specification and further repositories.
